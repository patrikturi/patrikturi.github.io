      <description>I never had a blog, the idea didn&#39;t feel like something I would want to do. Now I see it is an important way to improve at writing and share my thoughts.
I&#39;m going to write primarily about software development. Other interests can kick in as well, or just truths I have observed in life.
The content is addressed to other developers and lighter topics to people who like logical thinking.</description>
