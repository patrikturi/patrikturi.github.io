      <description>StarCraft 2 is one of the most difficult one versus one games. What can you learn from Starcraft and how does that help you become a better software developer?
Three Pillars of the Craft To be great at the game, one needs to master three areas:
 Game knowledge - Learn about SOLID principles and clean code. Know what you are doing. Execution of the strategy - There is no use of theory if you can not apply it.</description>

      <description>I never had a blog, the idea didn&#39;t feel like something I would want to do. Now I see it is an important way to improve at writing and share my thoughts.
I&#39;m going to write primarily about software development. Other interests can kick in as well, or just truths I have observed in life.
The content is addressed to other developers and lighter topics to people who like logical thinking.</description>
